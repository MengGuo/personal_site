-  Description: \n
This package contains a *plug-and-play* Python package for collision-avoidance in multi-agent system, based on reciprocal velocity obstacles ([https://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/RVO/icra2008.pdf RVO]) and hybrid reciprocal velocity obstacles ([https://www.cs.unc.edu/~geom/RVO/icra2008.pdf HRVO]).
- Features: \n
-- Takes a 2D workspace with any number of non-overlaping circular or square obstacles
-- Any number of dynamic agents with non-zero volume.
-- Allow the choice of VO, RVO, HRVO.
-- *Direct plug-and-play* and *fully integrate-able  with your control objective*, i.e., the output velocity is a minimal modification of the desired velocity.
-- Scalable and fast, see examples below.
