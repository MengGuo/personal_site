= Meng's Biography


== Bio
In May 2018, I joined [https://www.bosch-ai.com/ Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)] at Renningen as a research scientist, specialized in [https://www.bosch-ai.com/our-people/team-renningen/ Reinforcement Learning and AI-based Planning].  

In March 2017, I came back to KTH as a Postdoc associate, working with [http://www.s3.kth.se/~dimos/ Prof. Dimos V. Dimarogonas]. 

In March 2016, I joined [https://duke.edu/ Duke University], as a Postdoc associate, working with [http://people.duke.edu/~mz61/ Prof. Michael M. Zavlanos].

During 2017-2018, I received [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Giralt_PhD_Award EuRobotics George Giralt PhD Award 2017 - Finalist] and [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6862138/ European Embedded Control Institute (EECI) PhD Award 2017 - Finalist] in recognition of my PhD Thesis work.

In January 2016, I received my Doctoral degree from KTH. 
    
During April-July, 2015, I worked at [http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/ GRITS Lab] of Georgia Tech, Atlanta, as a visiting scholar. Supervised by Prof. [http://users.ece.gatech.edu/magnus/ Magnus Egerstedt].

In August 2011, I joined the Automatic Control Lab at the School of Electrical Engineering in KTH as a graduate student. My supervisors are [http://www.ee.kth.se/~kallej/index.html Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson] and [http://www.s3.kth.se/~dimos/ Prof. Dimos V. Dimarogonas]. My research mainly relates to distributed control of multi-agent networks.

In June 2011, I received the M.Sc. degree within the programme [http://www.kth.se/en/studies/programmes/master/programmes/2.1749/master-s-programme-in-systems-control-and-robotics-1.8733 System, Control and Robotics] from KTH.\n

In August 2006, I became a Bachelor student in [http://en.njtu.edu.cn/ Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU)], three years after which I was selected as an exchange student to [http://www.kth.se/?l=en_UK Royal Institute of Technology(KTH)].\n

I was born in December 1988 at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangyang Hubei, China].\n
